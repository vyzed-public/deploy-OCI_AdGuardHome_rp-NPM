# deploy-OCI_AdGuardHome_rp-NPM
Explore practical deployments of simple AdGuard Home instance(s) onto the free service tier of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure via Portainer stacks using Docker compose container configs that implement a reverse proxy for front-end network services.

### Background:

This service deployment relies on the previous project: [deploy-OCI_Portainer-NPM-frontend](https://github.com/vyzed-public/deploy-OCI_Portainer-NPM-frontend/tree/main)
* Explore practical deployment of a Portainer web GUI instance onto the free service tier of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure that implements a reverse proxy for front-end network services using Nginx Proxy Manager.

### Objective:

---

### Approach:
* As we proceed, we'll [track our progress on a per-issue basis](https://github.com/vyzed-public/deploy-OCI_Portainer-NPM-frontend/issues), in a "GSD using micro-tasks" manner.   
* Useful SOPs can be constructed from the [project history](https://github.com/vyzed-public/deploy-OCI_Portainer-NPM-frontend/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20sort%3Acreated-asc) (tracked via the ordered issues).
* A collection of useful [Resources, Tutorials, & Benchmark Projects](https://github.com/vyzed-public/deploy-OCI_AdGuardHome_rp-NPM/wiki/Useful-Resources,-Tutorials,-&-Benchmark-Projects) are in the project wiki.

### Results:

Deployments to the following active instances:  
* Public DNS service: https://dns.ns01.vyzed.net
* AdGuard Home web GUI: https://adguard.ns01.vyzed.net
